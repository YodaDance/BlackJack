# BlackJack

Classical BlackJack, where you play against the computer (only single play). During first flop you'll find one out of two card of the computer, your hand is output on the screen.
You can either 'stand' or 'hit' a card after the 1st flop. If you get more than 21, computer wins always. If you stand, then both hands are checked.
Your Bank is 1000 as default. So you can make some bets.
After the turn game asks you if you wanna continue playing.

It is my first beginner project. Thank you and have fun!
